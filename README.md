formatted html and javascript file
During the cleanup process i run the command npx eslint . --fix and the following issues were resolved:
Syntax Correction: Added missing semicolons in script.js.
Code Style: Converted inconsistent double quotes to single quotes in JavaScript strings.
HTML Re-formatting: Fixed deep nesting and irregular indentation in the Bootstrap form layouts within index.html.
Variable Cleanup: Identified and addressed minor unused variables in the state management logic.
Readability: Improved the spacing between function blocks to make the logic easier to follow
